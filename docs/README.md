Buck is a tool for rapidly prototyping Kubernetes controllers. With a Helm chart and a Brigade script, you can quickly build a complete Kubernetes controller. Say goodbye to thousands of lines of generated Go code! This is your onramp to using your own Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) inside of Kubernetes.

This guide explains how to use Buck.
